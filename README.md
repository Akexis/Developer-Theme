# Developer-Theme
###Wordpress skeleton theme meant for fast building

This theme structure was built out of the need for rapid prototyping.  I was working for an SEO agency house and often we'd need to convert a client's website to give us better capabilities.  This meant a website had to turned over in a few days and so this theme became a good starting point - all of the necessities, none of the frills.

Wish I had utilized Github sooner.

##All the Goodies

This theme is built with the following:

* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [Animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

##Use as an Example

It took me a long time to piece together a lot of this code and could still use refinement.  Its development was very organic, based on the needs of each client as they came in and my philosophy was less is more whenever possible.  Hack it, strip it, rework it, tell me how it can get better.
